Greet your new joining members with a Welcome Message that you can implement into your own bot.  

Better looking appeal than any other **Welcome Message** features I've seen in popular bots â€”  
plus, this way you can have your own bot's name displayed welcoming them in.  

You can also use the Welcome Message to alternate through your server's emojis for a fun looking welcome channel.
